Their conceptions of ornament anddecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were theyevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, butchanges of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at allseriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the otherartificial additions to their bodily resources that their greatsuperiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, arejust in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have workedout. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodiesaccording to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take abicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact thatwhat is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanismis absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought toearth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One wouldhave at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it iscurious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon thewheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And notonly did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), orabstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little useis made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circularmotions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of themachinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving oversmall but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon thismatter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of theirmachines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature ofthe disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawnclosely and powerfully together when traversed by a current ofelectricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, wasattained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machinewhich, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking thecylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martianslying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectualtentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.\n\nWhile I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, andnoting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of hispresence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face,and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only oneof us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a timewhile he enjoyed that privilege.\n\nWhen I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put togetherseveral of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinderinto a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down onthe left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emittingjets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating andembanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was whichhad caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that hadkept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked.So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian atall.\n\nThe arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peepholeinto the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martianmight see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began tofeel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of thesunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but atfirst the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the sculleryin heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recallnow with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger inwhich we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, wecould yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight.

So many people were abroadeverywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incrediblethat any great proportion of the population could have been slain. Butthen I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, howshaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and thatevery other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all withone of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grimresolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a cityof tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sentus by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showeddismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at thecorners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by theMartians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the redweed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.\n\nAt the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts ofthat grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of thered weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was theplacard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_.I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most ofit was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing hadamused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo onthe back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the newsorganisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing freshexcept that already in one week the examination of the Martianmechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, thearticle assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secretof Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains thatwere taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casualconversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. ToClapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the BlackSmoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at ClaphamJunction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds ofout-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customarynavvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.\n\nAll down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt andunfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue ofits unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along theline. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass ofred weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. TheSurrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the redclimber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nurserygrounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. Anumber of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy inthe midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully inthe morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson withthe weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, andvery painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from thescorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-greensoftness of the eastward hills.","numberOfWords":2999.0,"user":{"username":"want","numberOfComments":5.0},"tags":["orchids","hoarse","of","and","he"],"numberOfComments":1.0,"comments":[{"text":"Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with itsguarding giants.

The artist had evidently made ahasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledgeended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without eitherflexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony ofeffect.

They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feetin diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had nonostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense ofsmell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and justbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—Iscarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almostuseless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteenslender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eighteach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by thatdistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_.

Itseems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure oftheir first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.\n\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martianshave actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of anobserver on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous markingappeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almostsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character wasdetected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see thedrawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully theirremarkable resemblance in character.\n\nAt any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views ofthe human future must be greatly modified by these events. We havelearned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and asecure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen goodor evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that inthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is notwithout its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that sereneconfidence in the future which is the most fruitful source ofdecadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, andit has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal ofmankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians havewatched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Bethat as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be norelaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fierydarts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fallan unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.\n\nThe broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely beexaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasionthat through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the pettysurface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians canreach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossiblefor men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earthuninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of lifethat has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planetwithin its toils.","numberOfWords":2181.0,"user":{"username":"harassed","numberOfComments":2.0},"tags":["He","the","no","even","he"],"numberOfComments":1.0,"comments":[{"text":"“And what will they do with us?” I said.","user":"intermittence","likes":["sofar"]}]},{"text":"“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones!

The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, untilat last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All nightthrough their destructive tubes advanced.

It is commonly supposed that theycommunicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (writtenevidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which Ihave already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source ofinformation concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so muchof the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for anaccident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closelytime after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six ofthem sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operationstogether without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hootinginvariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory tothe suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least anelementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I amconvinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martiansinterchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I havebeen convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before theMartian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, Ihad written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.\n\nThe Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament anddecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were theyevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, butchanges of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at allseriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the otherartificial additions to their bodily resources that their greatsuperiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, arejust in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have workedout. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodiesaccording to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take abicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact thatwhat is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanismis absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought toearth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One wouldhave at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it iscurious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon thewheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And notonly did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), orabstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little useis made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circularmotions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of themachinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving oversmall but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon thismatter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of theirmachines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature ofthe disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawnclosely and powerfully together when traversed by a current ofelectricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, wasattained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machinewhich, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking thecylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martianslying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectualtentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.\n\nWhile I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, andnoting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of hispresence by pulling violently at my arm.

That last stage of exhaustion, which tous is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for theinhabitants of Mars.

Butthen I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leatheryintegument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the truenature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisationmy interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nauseano longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed andmotionless, and under no urgency of action.\n\nThey were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible toconceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feetin diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had nonostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense ofsmell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and justbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—Iscarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almostuseless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteenslender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eighteach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by thatdistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I sawthese Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring toraise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increasedweight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.

On Mars, however, just the reverse hasapparently been the case.\n\nIt is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer ofquasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, didforecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martiancondition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and Irecall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_.He pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfectionof mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; theperfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts ofthe human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would liein the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages.The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part ofthe body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,the hands would grow larger.\n\nThere is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians wehave beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression ofthe animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quitecredible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlikeourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the lattergiving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at theexpense of the rest of the body.

The fact that it is scarcely one seventh ofthe volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to thetemperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and allthat is necessary for the support of animated existence.\n\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up tothe very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea thatintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that sinceMars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of thesuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows thatit is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.\n\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has alreadygone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is stilllargely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial regionthe midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk untilthey cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons changehuge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodicallyinundate its temperate zones.

It seems to me that it should be possible to definethe position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep asustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate thearrival of the next attack.\n\nIn that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillerybefore it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or theymight be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. Itseems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure oftheir first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.\n\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martianshave actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of anobserver on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous markingappeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almostsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character wasdetected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see thedrawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully theirremarkable resemblance in character.\n\nAt any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views ofthe human future must be greatly modified by these events. We havelearned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and asecure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen goodor evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that inthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is notwithout its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that sereneconfidence in the future which is the most fruitful source ofdecadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, andit has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal ofmankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians havewatched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Bethat as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be norelaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fierydarts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fallan unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.","numberOfWords":2189.0,"user":{"username":"went","numberOfComments":3.0},"tags":["orchids","When","earthworks","of","story"],"numberOfComments":1.0,"comments":[{"text":"But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and mydominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast.

So many people were abroadeverywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incrediblethat any great proportion of the population could have been slain. Butthen I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, howshaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and thatevery other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all withone of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grimresolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a cityof tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sentus by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showeddismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at thecorners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by theMartians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the redweed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.\n\nAt the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts ofthat grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of thered weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was theplacard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_.I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most ofit was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing hadamused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo onthe back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the newsorganisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing freshexcept that already in one week the examination of the Martianmechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, thearticle assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secretof Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains thatwere taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casualconversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. ToClapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the BlackSmoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at ClaphamJunction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds ofout-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customarynavvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.\n\nAll down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt andunfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue ofits unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along theline. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass ofred weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. TheSurrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the redclimber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nurserygrounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. Anumber of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy inthe midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully inthe morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson withthe weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, andvery painful to the eye.
